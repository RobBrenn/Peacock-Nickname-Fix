# Peacock-Nickname-Fix

A Crusader Kings 2 mod that fixed the incorrectly displayed nickname "the Peacock" by creating a localisation file.

The nickname in the base game displayed as "nick_the_peacock" ingame, when the standard format should show "the Peacock", this mod adds the localisation file that lets the game display it correctly.

Only changes localisation, so should still allow achievments.

Works for for Crusader Kings 2 version 3.0. Future versions will probably fix this.
